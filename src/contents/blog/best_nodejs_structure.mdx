The most popular web framework for building Node.js servers currently is Express.js. With this robust backend server framework, you can build servers that support routing, middleware, and view systems using view engines like Pug or EJS.

In this tutorial, we are going to build a simple Node.js REST API todo application using what I believe is the best structure. We will be using Express in combination with TypeScript to make this application type-safe.

Lastly, we will use Prisma with MySQL for saving data.

To follow this tutorial without any trouble, it is required that you have Node.js v16 and above installed, as well as MySQL.

For Windows users, the easiest way to install MySQL is by installing a PHP development environment called XAMPP.

## What is typescript?

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, built upon it to introduce additional types to the language. Its primary purpose is to enforce the inclusion of types where necessary. This not only aids in preventing common type-related bugs, such as comparing strings to numbers, but also enhances development tools like VSCode by providing excellent auto-completion features.

## What is Prisma?

Prisma is a practical tool for Node.js that streamlines database tasks. It works seamlessly with TypeScript to prevent common errors such as mixing up strings and numbers. This collaboration ensures early error detection, particularly when using VSCode for efficient coding. Notably, Prisma supports databases like PostgreSQL and MySQL, making it versatile.

## Birds-eye view of the app

We are going to build a simple todo API application. What's original, right? But the point of this project is not to impress other people; it is to showcase the Node.js Express structure. So the kind of project is not really relevant in my opinion. As long as the project covers all the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) operations.

### Routes

This web application will support all available HTTP request methods: GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.

All the possible routes will look like this.

| Methods | Urls | Actions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | api/todos | Getting all the todos |
| GET | api/todos/:id | Get Todo by id |
| POST | api/todos | Adds a new Todo |
| PUT | api/todos/:id | Updates a Todo by id |

To test all of the API routes described above, we are going to make use of Postman.
