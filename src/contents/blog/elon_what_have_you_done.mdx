I don’t know what Elon has done with Twitter, but the Twitter API was one hell of a pain to make work. What actually should be an easy operation has become somewhat convoluted to integrate. The only action I wanted to perform was to post a tweet with an image attached to it.

That’s it.

I needed an API key, okay, that was easy. But somehow the Twitter API still gave me this error:

In this article, I will not go into actually using the Twitter API, but simply prepping your Twitter project to work with the API properly so that you can tweet your memes programmatically.

First, you need to navigate to the Twitter Developer Portal and log in with your Twitter account.

https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/dashboard

After logging in, you will be greeted with the Twitter dashboard.

It is quite clear what button you should press in order to create your Twitter project to retrieve the API keys. If you don’t know it, don’t stress, I got you. Just simply click on the create project button.
