With the technology nowadays it is very easy to send an sms with your webapplication. In this tutorial I will show you how to send an sms with THE most robust fullstack framework in the modern day which is laravel. 

## Create a laravel project
First create an brand new laravel project and change directories to the laravel project and open the project with Visual Studio Code.
```bash
composer create-project laravel/laravel example-app

cd ./example-app

code .
```

## Install twilio sms package
Next up is to download the twilio package that enables us to use their service to send an sms with our laravel web application.

```bash
composer require twilio/sdk
```
## Retrieve the authentication keys from twilio
I won't go into the details about creating a twilio account etc. Regsiter an account on [Twlio](https://twilio.com/) and go to your console and copy both Account SID and Auth Token. Place these credentials in your `.env` file by their respective variables.

```env
TWILIO_SID=YOUR_SID_HERE
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN_HERE
```
## Creating a controller
With a new Laravel project you have to create a controller to connect a endpoint to it. Luckily with laravel you can generate an controller just by using the following command `php artisan make:controller YourController`. Let's call our controller SmsController so our command will look like this:
```env
php artisan make:controller SmsController
```
