> React: How to add shadcn to a NextJS project

The exact steps described here can also be found in the official Shadcn documentation.

Shadcn link: [Shadcn link](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation/next)

## Create Nextjs TypeScript Project with your terminal

### Initialize

Open up your terminal.

Run the following script, the following script will create a boilerplate Nextjs TypeScript project:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app --typescript --tailwind

```

Of course, you can name your project whatever you like.

To do this, you will have to replace `my-app` with the name you want to give your project.

### Change Directory

Now that we have the boilerplate setup, we can change the directory into that project:

```bash
cd my-app
```

## Installing Shadcn

Next, we'll install Shadcn.

### **Install Shadcn**

The following command will open up a dialog box that will guide you through the installation process:

```bash
npx shadcn-ui@latest init
```

You will be asked a series of questions:
* Which style would you like to use?
  * This doesn't matter, you can choose any style you like. You can change this later if you would like to.
* Which color would you like to use as base color?
  * Also this doesn't matter, you can choose any color you like. You can change this later if you would like to.
* Do you want to use CSS variables for colors?
  * Just type `yes` or `no` depending on your preference. But I would recommend you to use CSS variables for colors. It is easier to manage.

```bash
Which style would you like to use? › Default
Which color would you like to use as base color? › Slate
Do you want to use CSS variables for colors? › no / yes
```

### **Custom fonts (Optional)**

If you would like to use custom fonts, you can add them to your root layout file.

```jsx
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
export default {
  content: [
    "./index.html",
    "./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}

```

### **Add the Tailwind Directives to Your CSS**

In your **`./src/index.css`** file, add the **`@tailwind`** directives for each of Tailwind's layers.
