## Create Nextjs TypeScript Project with your terminal

### Initialize

Open up your terminal.

Run the following script, the following script will create a boilerplate Nextjs TypeScript project:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app --typescript --tailwind

```

Of course, you can name your project whatever you like.

To do this, you will have to replace `my-app` with the name you want to give your project.

### Change Directory

Now that we have the boilerplate setup, we can change the directory into that project:

```bash
cd my-app
```

## Installing tailwind

Next, we'll install Tailwind.

### **Install Tailwind CSS**

First, install **`tailwindcss`** and its peer dependencies. After that, it will generate your **`tailwind.config.js`** and **`postcss.config.js`** files.

```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p

```

### **Configure Your Template Paths**

Update your **`tailwind.config.js`** file to include the paths to all your template files.

```jsx
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
export default {
  content: [
    "./index.html",
    "./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}

```

### **Add the Tailwind Directives to Your CSS**

In your **`./src/index.css`** file, add the **`@tailwind`** directives for each of Tailwind's layers.
