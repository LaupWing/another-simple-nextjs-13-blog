> Laravel: Pivot Tables

If you have many to many relationships in Laravel, you'll need to create a pivot table. This table will contain the foreign keys of the two tables you're connecting.

Below you can see an example of a pivot table for a many to many relationship between the `emails` and `templates` tables.

```php
Schema::create("email_templates", function (Blueprint $table) {
    $table->id();
    $table->foreignId("email_id")->constrained();
    $table->foreignId("template_id")->constrained();
    $table->timestamps();
});
```s
