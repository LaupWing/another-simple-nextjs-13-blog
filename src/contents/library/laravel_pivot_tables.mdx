> Laravel: Pivot Tables

If you have many to many relationships in Laravel, you'll need to create a pivot table. This table will contain the foreign keys of the two tables you're connecting.

```php
So choose the one that works best for you and stick with it.

```php
<?php
return new class extends Migration
{
    /**
     * Run the migrations.
     */
    public function up(): void
    {
      Schema::create("genre_book", function (Blueprint $table) {
        $table->foreignId("book_id");
        $table->foreign("book_id")
          ->references("id")
          ->on("books");
        $table->foreignId("genre_id");
        $table->foreign("genre_id")
          ->references("id")
          ->on("genres");
      });
    }

    /**
     * Reverse the migrations.
     */
    public function down(): void
    {
        //
    }
};
```

However, there's a more effective approach! Import ComponentPropsWithoutRef and assign it to the element you want to set props for.

## Code

```jsx
import type { FC, ComponentPropsWithoutRef } from "react";

export const DivContainer: FC<ComponentPropsWithoutRef<"div">> = () => (
  <div></div>
);
```

This method enhances the development experience by letting TypeScript infer and enforce the correct props for the specified HTML element.
