> Typescript Record Type for Objects

Record type within typescript is used to define an object with a dynamic key and value.

In the example below we have a type called SomeObject which is a Record type with a string key and a number value.

```ts
type SomeObject = Record<string, number>
```

However, there's a more effective approach! Import ComponentPropsWithoutRef and assign it to the element you want to set props for.

## Code

```jsx
import type { FC, ComponentPropsWithoutRef } from "react";

export const DivContainer: FC<ComponentPropsWithoutRef<"div">> = () => (
  <div></div>
);
```

This method enhances the development experience by letting TypeScript infer and enforce the correct props for the specified HTML element.
