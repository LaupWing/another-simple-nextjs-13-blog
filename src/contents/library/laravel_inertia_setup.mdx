> Laravel: Inertia.js, React and Typescript setup

In order to make Laravel work with Inertia, React and Typescript, you need to install a few packages. This is a great starting point for a new project, if you don't feel like using Laravel Breeze.

The reason why you may not want to use Laravel Breeze is because it comes with a lot of extra stuff that you may not need.

So if you are interested in a more minimal setup, then this is the way to go. Typescript is of course optional, but it's a great way to make your code more robust. Otherwise, you can just leave the typescript part out.

```php
<?php
public function up(): void
  {
    Schema::create("books", function (Blueprint $table) {
      $table->foreignId("author_id");
      $table->foreign("author_id")
        ->references("id")
        ->on("authors");
    });
  }
```

```php
<?php
public function up(): void
  {
    Schema::create("books", function (Blueprint $table) {
      $table->unsignedBigInteger("author_id");
      $table->foreign("author_id")->references("id")->on("authors");
    });
  }
```

```php
<?php
public function up(): void
  {
    Schema::create("books", function (Blueprint $table) {
      $table->foreignIdFor(\App\Models\Author::class);
    });
  }
```
