> Laravel Foreign relationships

Many developers define an interface named `Props` for their React components and consider it sufficient.

```php
<?php
public function up(): void
  {
    Schema::create("books", function (Blueprint $table) {
      $table->foreignId("author_id");
      $table->foreign("author_id")
        ->references("id")
        ->on("authors");
    });
  }
```

However, there's a more effective approach! Import ComponentPropsWithoutRef and assign it to the element you want to set props for.

## Code

```jsx
import type { FC, ComponentPropsWithoutRef } from "react";

export const DivContainer: FC<ComponentPropsWithoutRef<"div">> = () => (
  <div></div>
);
```

This method enhances the development experience by letting TypeScript infer and enforce the correct props for the specified HTML element.
