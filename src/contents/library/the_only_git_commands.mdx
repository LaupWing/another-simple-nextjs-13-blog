> The only git commands you really only need

## 1. Git Add All 📦

```bash
npx add .
```

An lazy developer is an good developer! Just add all the changes to the staging area, and then you can commit it later.

## 2. Git commit 💬

Add a commit message to the changes. You can use the new ai commit message generator from github, or you can use the old way to add a commit message.

```bash
git commit -m "Your commit message here"
```

## 3. Git Push 🫸

Push the changes to the remote repository.

```bash
git push
```

Create commitlint.config.js, you don't need to override the rules if you don't want to
