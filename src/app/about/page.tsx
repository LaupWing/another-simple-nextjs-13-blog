                  Hello! I'm Loc Nguyen, and my passion for programming has been with me since my early years. Although I attended IT universities, the broad curriculum didn't quite align with my main interest â€“ coding. Determined to pursue my passion, I took the self-taught route, starting with YouTube tutorials. Web development captured my heart, and I dove into building websites independently.
               </p>
               <p>
                  As coding became second nature, I decided to broaden my skills. I enrolled in a university program focused on web design called Communication Multimedia Design. Here, I not only delved deeper into coding but also recognized the significance of soft skills like communication, time management, and teamwork. I continue to refine these skills daily, understanding their crucial role in a developer's success.
               </p>
               <p>
                  With 5 years of experience as a web developer post-graduation, I've worked with various technologies. My expertise lies in Vue.js, React/Next.js, Node.js, and PHP/Laravel, primarily focusing on frontend frameworks. While my proficiency in backend frameworks like Node.js and especially Laravel spans 2 years, I've dedicated each day within that timeframe to backend programming. I'm also keen on expanding my knowledge in DevOps and cloud technologies.
               </p>
               <p>
                  This website serves as a platform for blogging and showcasing my projects. I believe that articulating my learnings enhances retention, and I'm eager to share my knowledge. Feel free to reach out, and I'll be delighted to assist you!
